She lingers my desires\nLike to a stepdame or a dowager\nLong withering out a young man's revenue.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\nFour days will quickly steep themselves in night;\nFour nights will quickly dream away the time;\nAnd then the moon, like to a silver bow\nNew-bent in heaven, shall behold the night\nOf our solemnities.\n\nTHESEUS  Go, Philostrate,\nStir up the Athenian youth to merriments.\nAwake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.\nTurn melancholy forth to funerals;\nThe pale companion is not for our pomp.\n[Philostrate exits.]\nHippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword\nAnd won thy love doing thee injuries,\nBut I will wed thee in another key,\nWith pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.\n\n[Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, and Lysander \n and Demetrius.]\n\n\nEGEUS\nHappy be Theseus, our renowned duke!\n\nTHESEUS\nThanks, good Egeus.

Be advised, fair maid.\nTo you, your father should be as a god,\nOne that composed your beauties, yea, and one\nTo whom you are but as a form in wax\nBy him imprinted, and within his power\nTo leave the figure or disfigure it.\nDemetrius is a worthy gentleman.\n\nHERMIA\nSo is Lysander.\n\nTHESEUS  In himself he is,\nBut in this kind, wanting your father's voice,\nThe other must be held the worthier.\n\nHERMIA\nI would my father looked but with my eyes.\n\nTHESEUS\nRather your eyes must with his judgment look.\n\nHERMIA\nI do entreat your Grace to pardon me.\nI know not by what power I am made bold,\nNor how it may concern my modesty\nIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts;\nBut I beseech your Grace that I may know\nThe worst that may befall me in this case\nIf I refuse to wed Demetrius.\n\nTHESEUS\nEither to die the death or to abjure\nForever the society of men.\nTherefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,\nKnow of your youth, examine well your blood,\nWhether (if you yield not to your father's choice)\nYou can endure the livery of a nun,\nFor aye to be in shady cloister mewed,\nTo live a barren sister all your life,\nChant\n######################\nOutput:",

Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your\nactors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.\n\nQUINCE  Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.\n\nBOTTOM  Ready. Name what part I am for, and\nproceed.\n\nQUINCE  You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.\n\nBOTTOM  What is Pyramus--a lover or a tyrant?\n\nQUINCE  A lover that kills himself most gallant for love.\n\nBOTTOM  That will ask some tears in the true performing\nof it. If I do it, let the audience look to their\neyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some\nmeasure. To the rest.--Yet my chief humor is for a\ntyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a\ncat in, to make all split:\n\n\tThe raging rocks\n\tAnd shivering shocks\n\tShall break the locks\n\t   Of prison gates.\n\tAnd Phibbus' car\n\tShall shine from far\n\tAnd make and mar\n\t   The foolish Fates.\n\nThis was lofty.

Thy Thisbe\ndear and lady dear!\"\n\nQUINCE  No, no, you must play Pyramus--and, Flute,\nyou Thisbe.\n\nBOTTOM  Well, proceed.\n\nQUINCE  Robin Starveling, the tailor.\n\nSTARVELING  Here, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE  Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe's\nmother.--Tom Snout, the tinker.\n\nSNOUT  Here, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE  You, Pyramus' father.--Myself, Thisbe's\nfather.--Snug the joiner, you the lion's part.--\nAnd I hope here is a play fitted.\n\nSNUG  Have you the lion's part written?

I will roar that I will\ndo any man's heart good to hear me. I will roar that\nI will make the Duke say \"Let him roar again.

But I will aggravate my\nvoice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking\ndove. I will roar you an 'twere any nightingale.\n\nQUINCE  You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus\nis a sweet-faced man, a proper man as one\nshall see in a summer's day, a most lovely gentlemanlike\nman. Therefore you must needs play \nPyramus.\n\nBOTTOM  Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I\nbest to play it in?\n\nQUINCE  Why, what you will.\n\nBOTTOM  I will discharge it in either your straw-color\nbeard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain\nbeard, or your French-crown-color beard,\nyour perfit yellow.\n\nQUINCE  Some of your French crowns have no hair at\nall, and then you will play barefaced.

Whither wander you?\n\nFAIRY\n\tOver hill, over dale,\n\t   Thorough bush, thorough brier,\n\tOver park, over pale,\n\t   Thorough flood, thorough fire;\n\tI do wander everywhere,\n\tSwifter than the moon's sphere.\n\tAnd I serve the Fairy Queen,\n\tTo dew her orbs upon the green.\n\tThe cowslips tall her pensioners be;\n\tIn their gold coats spots you see;\n\tThose be rubies, fairy favors;\n\tIn those freckles live their savors.\nI must go seek some dewdrops here\nAnd hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.\nFarewell, thou lob of spirits. I'll be gone.\nOur queen and all her elves come here anon.\n\nROBIN\nThe King doth keep his revels here tonight.\nTake heed the Queen come not within his sight,\nFor Oberon is passing fell and wrath\nBecause that she, as her attendant, hath\nA lovely boy stolen from an Indian king;\nShe never had so sweet a changeling.\nAnd jealous Oberon would have the child\nKnight of his train, to trace the forests wild.\nBut she perforce withholds the loved boy,\nCrowns him with flowers and makes him all her\njoy.\nAnd now they never meet in grove or green,\nBy fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen,\nBut they do square, that all their elves for fear\nCreep into acorn cups and hide them there.\n\nFAIRY\nEither I mistake your shape and making quite,\nOr else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite\nCalled Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he\nThat frights the maidens of the villagery,\nSkim milk, and sometimes labor in the quern\nAnd bootless make the breathless huswife churn,\nAnd sometime make the drink to bear no barm,\nMislead night wanderers, laughing at their harm?\nThose that \"Hobgoblin\" call you and \"sweet Puck,\"\nYou do their work, and they shall have good luck.\nAre not you he?\n\nROBIN  Thou speakest aright.\nI am that merry wanderer of the night.\nI jest to Oberon and make him smile\nWhen I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,\nNeighing in likeness of a filly foal.\nAnd sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl\nIn very likeness of a roasted crab,\nAnd, when she drinks, against her lips I bob\nAnd on her withered dewlap pour the ale.\nThe wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,\nSometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;\nThen slip I from her bum, down topples she\nAnd \"Tailor!\" cries and falls into a cough,\nAnd then the whole choir hold their hips and loffe\nAnd waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear\nA merrier hour was never wasted there.\nBut room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.\n\nFAIRY\nAnd here my mistress. Would that he were gone!\n\n[Enter Oberon the King of Fairies at one door, with his\ntrain, and Titania the Queen at another, with hers.]\n\n\nOBERON\nIll met by moonlight, proud Titania.\n\nTITANIA\nWhat, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence.\nI have forsworn his bed and company.\n\nOBERON\nTarry, rash wanton. Am not I thy lord?\n\nTITANIA\nThen I must be thy lady. But I know\nWhen thou hast stolen away from Fairyland\nAnd in the shape of Corin sat all day\nPlaying on pipes of corn and versing love\nTo amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,\nCome from the farthest steep of India,\nBut that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,\nYour buskined mistress and your warrior love,\nTo Theseus must be wedded, and you come\nTo give their bed joy and prosperity?\n\nOBERON\nHow canst thou thus for shame, Titania,\nGlance at my credit with Hippolyta,\nKnowing I know thy love to Theseus?\nDidst not thou lead him through the glimmering\nnight\nFrom Perigouna, whom he ravished,\nAnd make him with fair Aegles break his faith,\nWith Ariadne and Antiopa?\n\nTITANIA\nThese are the forgeries of jealousy;\n######################\nOutput:",

canst thou thus for shame, Titania,\nGlance at my credit with Hippolyta,\nKnowing I know thy love to Theseus?\nDidst not thou lead him through the glimmering\nnight\nFrom Perigouna, whom he ravished,\nAnd make him with fair Aegles break his faith,\nWith Ariadne and Antiopa?\n\nTITANIA\nThese are the forgeries of jealousy;\nAnd never, since the middle summer's spring,\nMet we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,\nBy paved fountain or by rushy brook,\nOr in the beached margent of the sea,\nTo dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,\nBut with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.\nTherefore the winds, piping to us in vain,\nAs in revenge have sucked up from the sea\nContagious fogs, which, falling in the land,\nHath every pelting river made so proud\nThat they have overborne their continents.\nThe ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain,\nThe plowman lost his sweat, and the green corn\nHath rotted ere his youth attained a beard.\nThe fold stands empty in the drowned field,\nAnd crows are fatted with the murrain flock.\nThe nine-men's-morris is filled up with mud,\nAnd the quaint mazes in the wanton green,\nFor lack of tread, are undistinguishable.\nThe human mortals want their winter here.\nNo night is now with hymn or carol blessed.\nTherefore the moon, the governess of floods,\nPale in her anger, washes all the air,\nThat rheumatic diseases do abound.\nAnd thorough this distemperature we see\nThe seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts\nFall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,\nAnd on old Hiems' thin and icy crown\nAn odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds\nIs, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,\nThe childing autumn, angry winter, change\nTheir wonted liveries, and the mazed world\nBy their increase now knows not which is which.\nAnd this same progeny of evils comes\nFrom our debate, from our dissension;\nWe are their parents and original.\n\nOBERON\nDo you amend it, then. It lies in you.\nWhy should Titania cross her Oberon?\nI do but beg a little changeling boy\nTo be my henchman.\n\nTITANIA  Set your heart at rest:\nThe Fairyland buys not the child of me.\nHis mother was a vot'ress of my order,\nAnd in the spiced Indian air by night\nFull often hath she gossiped by my side\nAnd sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,\nMarking th' embarked traders on the flood,\nWhen we have laughed to see the sails conceive\nAnd grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;\nWhich she, with pretty and with swimming gait,\nFollowing (her womb then rich with my young\nsquire),\nWould imitate and sail upon the land\nTo fetch me trifles and return again,\nAs from a voyage, rich with merchandise.\nBut she, being mortal, of that boy did die,\nAnd for her sake do I rear up her boy,\nAnd for her sake I will not part with him.\n\nOBERON\nHow long within this wood intend you stay?\n\nTITANIA\nPerchance till after Theseus' wedding day.\nIf you will patiently dance in our round\nAnd see our moonlight revels, go with us.\nIf not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.\n\nOBERON\nGive me that boy and I will go with thee.\n\nTITANIA\nNot for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.\nWe shall chide downright if I longer stay.\n[Titania and her fairies exit.]\n\nOBERON\nWell, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove\nTill I torment thee for this injury.--\nMy gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb'rest\nSince once I sat upon a promontory\nAnd heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back\nUttering such dulcet and harmonious breath\nThat the rude sea grew civil at her song\nAnd certain stars shot madly from their spheres\nTo hear the sea-maid's music.\n\nROBIN  I remember.\n\nOBERON\nThat very time I saw (but thou couldst not),\nFlying between the cold moon and the Earth,\nCupid all armed. A certain aim he took\nAt a fair vestal throned by the west,\nAnd loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow\nAs it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.\nBut I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft\nQuenched in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon,\nAnd the imperial vot'ress passed on\nIn maiden meditation, fancy-free.\nYet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.\nIt fell upon a little western flower,\nBefore, milk-white, now purple with love's wound,\nAnd maidens call it \"love-in-idleness.\"\nFetch me that flower; the herb I showed thee once.\nThe juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid\nWill make or man or woman madly dote\nUpon the next live creature that it sees.\nFetch me this herb, and be thou here again\nEre the leviathan can swim a league.\n\nROBIN\nI'll put a girdle round about the Earth\nIn forty minutes.\t[He exits.]\n\nOBERON  Having once this juice,\nI'll watch Titania when she is asleep\nAnd drop the liquor of it in her eyes\n######################\nOutput:",

First, Pyramus\nmust draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies\ncannot abide. How answer you that?\n\nSNOUT  By 'r lakin, a parlous fear.\n\nSTARVELING  I believe we must leave the killing out,\nwhen all is done.\n\nBOTTOM  Not a whit! I have a device to make all well.\nWrite me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to\nsay we will do no harm with our swords and that\nPyramus is not killed indeed. And, for the more\nbetter assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not\nPyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put them\nout of fear.\n\nQUINCE  Well, we will have such a prologue, and it shall\nbe written in eight and six.\n\nBOTTOM  No, make it two more. Let it be written in\neight and eight.\n\nSNOUT  Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?\n\nSTARVELING  I fear it, I promise you.\n\nBOTTOM  Masters, you ought to consider with yourself,\nto bring in (God shield us!) a lion among ladies is a\nmost dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearful\nwildfowl than your lion living, and we ought to look\nto 't.\n\nSNOUT  Therefore another prologue must tell he is not\na lion.\n\nBOTTOM  Nay, you must name his name, and half his\nface must be seen through the lion's neck, and he\nhimself must speak through, saying thus, or to the\nsame defect: \"Ladies,\" or \"Fair ladies, I would\nwish you,\" or \"I would request you,\" or \"I would\nentreat you not to fear, not to tremble! My life for\nyours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were\npity of my life. No, I am no such thing. I am a man as\nother men are.\" And there indeed let him name his\nname and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.\n\nQUINCE  Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard\nthings: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber,\nfor you know Pyramus and Thisbe meet by\nmoonlight.\n\nSNOUT  Doth the moon shine that night we play our\nplay?\n\nBOTTOM  A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac.\nFind out moonshine, find out moonshine.\n[Quince takes out a book.]\n\nQUINCE  Yes, it doth shine that night.\n\nBOTTOM  Why, then, may you leave a casement of the\ngreat chamber window, where we play, open, and\nthe moon may shine in at the casement.\n\nQUINCE  Ay, or else one must come in with a bush of\nthorns and a lantern and say he comes to disfigure\nor to present the person of Moonshine. Then there\nis another thing: we must have a wall in the great\nchamber, for Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story,\ndid talk through the chink of a wall.\n\nSNOUT  You can never bring in a wall. What say you,\nBottom?\n\nBOTTOM  Some man or other must present Wall.

She lingers my desires\nLike to a stepdame or a dowager\nLong withering out a young man's revenue.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\nFour days will quickly steep themselves in night;\nFour nights will quickly dream away the time;\nAnd then the moon, like to a silver bow\nNew-bent in heaven, shall behold the night\nOf our solemnities.\n\nTHESEUS  Go, Philostrate,\nStir up the Athenian youth to merriments.\nAwake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.\nTurn melancholy forth to funerals;\nThe pale companion is not for our pomp.\n[Philostrate exits.]\nHippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword\nAnd won thy love doing thee injuries,\nBut I will wed thee in another key,\nWith pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.\n\n[Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, and Lysander \n and Demetrius.]\n\n\nEGEUS\nHappy be Theseus, our renowned duke!\n\nTHESEUS\nThanks, good Egeus. What's the news with thee?\n\nEGEUS\nFull of vexation come I, with complaint\nAgainst my child, my daughter Hermia.--\nStand forth, Demetrius.--My noble lord,\nThis man hath my consent to marry her.--\nStand forth, Lysander.--And, my gracious duke,\nThis man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.--\nThou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes\nAnd interchanged love tokens with my child.\nThou hast by moonlight at her window sung\nWith feigning voice verses of feigning love\nAnd stol'n the impression of her fantasy\nWith bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,\nKnacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats--messengers\nOf strong prevailment in unhardened youth.\nWith cunning hast thou filched my daughter's heart,\nTurned her obedience (which is due to me)\nTo stubborn harshness.--And, my gracious duke,\nBe it so she will not here before your Grace\nConsent to marry with Demetrius,\nI beg the ancient privilege of Athens:\nAs she is mine, I may dispose of her,\nWhich shall be either to this gentleman\nOr to her death, according to our law\nImmediately provided in that case.\n\nTHESEUS\nWhat say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid.\nTo you, your father should be as a god,\nOne that composed your beauties, yea, and one\nTo whom you are but as a form in wax\nBy him imprinted, and within his power\nTo leave the figure or disfigure it.\nDemetrius is a worthy gentleman.\n\nHERMIA\nSo is Lysander.\n\nTHESEUS  In himself he is,\nBut in this kind, wanting your father's voice,\nThe other must be held the worthier.\n\nHERMIA\nI would my father looked but with my eyes.\n\nTHESEUS\nRather your eyes must with his judgment look.\n\nHERMIA\nI do entreat your Grace to pardon me.\nI know not by what power I am made bold,\nNor how it may concern my modesty\nIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts;\nBut I beseech your Grace that I may know\nThe worst that may befall me in this case\nIf I refuse to wed Demetrius.\n\nTHESEUS\nEither to die the death or to abjure\nForever the society of men.\nTherefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,\nKnow of your youth, examine well your blood,\nWhether (if you yield not to your father's choice)\nYou can endure the livery of a nun,\nFor aye to be in shady cloister mewed,\nTo live a barren sister all your life,\nChant\n######################\nOutput:",

How now, mad spirit?\nWhat night-rule now about this haunted grove?\n\nROBIN\nMy mistress with a monster is in love.\nNear to her close and consecrated bower,\nWhile she was in her dull and sleeping hour,\nA crew of patches, rude mechanicals,\nThat work for bread upon Athenian stalls,\nWere met together to rehearse a play\nIntended for great Theseus' nuptial day.\nThe shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,\nWho Pyramus presented in their sport,\nForsook his scene and entered in a brake.\nWhen I did him at this advantage take,\nAn ass's noll I fixed on his head.\nAnon his Thisbe must be answered,\nAnd forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,\nAs wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,\nOr russet-pated choughs, many in sort,\nRising and cawing at the gun's report,\nSever themselves and madly sweep the sky,\nSo at his sight away his fellows fly,\nAnd, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls.\nHe \"Murder\" cries and help from Athens calls.\nTheir sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus\nstrong,\nMade senseless things begin to do them wrong;\nFor briers and thorns at their apparel snatch,\nSome sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things\ncatch.\nI led them on in this distracted fear\nAnd left sweet Pyramus translated there.\nWhen in that moment, so it came to pass,\nTitania waked and straightway loved an ass.\n\nOBERON\nThis falls out better than I could devise.\nBut hast thou yet latched the Athenian's eyes\nWith the love juice, as I did bid thee do?\n\nROBIN\nI took him sleeping--that is finished, too--\nAnd the Athenian woman by his side,\nThat, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.\n\n[Enter Demetrius and Hermia.]\n\n\nOBERON\nStand close.

Would he have stolen away\nFrom sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon\nThis whole Earth may be bored, and that the moon\nMay through the center creep and so displease\nHer brother's noontide with th' Antipodes.\nIt cannot be but thou hast murdered him.\nSo should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nSo should the murdered look, and so should I,\nPierced through the heart with your stern cruelty.\nYet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,\nAs yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.\n\nHERMIA\nWhat's this to my Lysander? Where is he?\nAh, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?\n\nDEMETRIUS\nI had rather give his carcass to my hounds.\n\nHERMIA\nOut, dog! Out, cur! Thou driv'st me past the bounds\nOf maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?\nHenceforth be never numbered among men.\nO, once tell true! Tell true, even for my sake!\nDurst thou have looked upon him, being awake?\nAnd hast thou killed him sleeping? O brave touch!\nCould not a worm, an adder, do so much?\nAn adder did it, for with doubler tongue\nThan thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.\n######################\nOutput:",

None of noble sort\nWould so offend a virgin and extort\nA poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.\n\nLYSANDER\nYou are unkind, Demetrius. Be not so,\nFor you love Hermia; this you know I know.\nAnd here with all goodwill, with all my heart,\nIn Hermia's love I yield you up my part.\nAnd yours of Helena to me bequeath,\nWhom I do love and will do till my death.\n\nHELENA\nNever did mockers waste more idle breath.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nLysander, keep thy Hermia. I will none.\nIf e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.\nMy heart to her but as guest-wise sojourned,\nAnd now to Helen is it home returned,\nThere to remain.\n\nLYSANDER  Helen, it is not so.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nDisparage not the faith thou dost not know,\nLest to thy peril thou aby it dear.\nLook where thy love comes. Yonder is thy dear.\n\n[Enter Hermia.]\n\n\nHERMIA, [to Lysander]\nDark night, that from the eye his function takes,\nThe ear more quick of apprehension makes;\nWherein it doth impair the seeing sense,\nIt pays the hearing double recompense.\nThou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;\nMine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.\nBut why unkindly didst thou leave me so?\n\nLYSANDER\nWhy should he stay whom love doth press to go?\n\nHERMIA\nWhat love could press Lysander from my side?\n\nLYSANDER\nLysander's love, that would not let him bide,\nFair Helena, who more engilds the night\nThan all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.\nWhy seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee\nknow\nThe hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?\n\nHERMIA\nYou speak not as you think. It cannot be.\n\nHELENA\nLo, she is one of this confederacy!\nNow I perceive they have conjoined all three\nTo fashion this false sport in spite of me.--\nInjurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid,\nHave you conspired, have you with these contrived,\nTo bait me with this foul derision?\nIs all the counsel that we two have shared,\nThe sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent\nWhen we have chid the hasty-footed time\nFor parting us--O, is all forgot?\nAll schooldays' friendship, childhood innocence?\nWe, Hermia, like two artificial gods,\nHave with our needles created both one flower,\nBoth on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,\nBoth warbling of one song, both in one key,\nAs if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds\nHad been incorporate. So we grew together\nLike to a double cherry, seeming parted,\nBut yet an union in partition,\nTwo lovely berries molded on one stem;\nSo with two seeming bodies but one heart,\nTwo of the first, like coats in heraldry,\nDue but to one, and crowned with one crest.\nAnd will you rent our ancient love asunder,\nTo join with men in scorning your poor friend?\nIt is not friendly; 'tis not maidenly.\nOur sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,\nThough I alone do feel the injury.\n\nHERMIA\nI am amazed at your words.\nI scorn you not. It seems that you scorn me.\n\nHELENA\nHave you not set Lysander, as in scorn,\nTo follow me and praise my eyes and face,\nAnd made your other love, Demetrius,\nWho even but now did spurn me with his foot,\nTo call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,\nPrecious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this\nTo her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander\nDeny your love (so rich within his soul)\nAnd tender me, forsooth, affection,\nBut by your setting on, by your consent?\nWhat though I be not so in grace as you,\nSo hung upon with love, so fortunate,\nBut miserable most, to love unloved?\nThis you should pity rather than despise.\n\nHERMIA\nI understand not what you mean by this.\n\nHELENA\nAy, do. Persever, counterfeit sad looks,\nMake mouths upon me when I turn my back,\nWink each at other, hold the sweet jest up.\nThis sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.\nIf you have any pity, grace, or manners,\nYou would not make me such an argument.\nBut fare you well. 'Tis partly my own fault,\nWhich death or absence soon shall remedy.\n\nLYSANDER\nStay, gentle Helena. Hear my excuse,\nMy love, my life, my soul, fair Helena.\n\nHELENA\nO excellent!\n\nHERMIA, [to Lysander]\nSweet, do not scorn her so.\n\nDEMETRIUS, [to Lysander]\nIf she cannot entreat, I can compel.\n\nLYSANDER\nThou canst compel no more than she entreat.\nThy threats have no more strength than her weak\nprayers.--\nHelen, I love thee.

Are not you Lysander?\nI am as fair now as I was erewhile.\nSince night you loved me; yet since night you left\nme.\nWhy, then, you left me--O, the gods forbid!--\nIn earnest, shall I say?\n\nLYSANDER  Ay, by my life,\nAnd never did desire to see thee more.\nTherefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt.\nBe certain, nothing truer, 'tis no jest\nThat I do hate thee and love Helena.\n[Hermia turns him loose.]\n\nHERMIA\nO me! [To Helena.] You juggler, you cankerblossom,\nYou thief of love! What, have you come by night\nAnd stol'n my love's heart from him?\n\nHELENA  Fine, i' faith.\nHave you no modesty, no maiden shame,\nNo touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear\nImpatient answers from my gentle tongue?\nFie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!\n\nHERMIA\n\"Puppet\"? Why so? Ay, that way goes the game.\nNow I perceive that she hath made compare\nBetween our statures; she hath urged her height,\nAnd with her personage, her tall personage,\nHer height, forsooth, she hath prevailed with him.\nAnd are you grown so high in his esteem\nBecause I am so dwarfish and so low?\nHow low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak!\nHow low am I? I am not yet so low\nBut that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.\n\nHELENA\nI pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,\nLet her not hurt me. I was never curst;\nI have no gift at all in shrewishness.\nI am a right maid for my cowardice.\nLet her not strike me. You perhaps may think,\nBecause she is something lower than myself,\nThat I can match her.\n\nHERMIA  \"Lower\"? Hark, again!\n\nHELENA\nGood Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.\nI evermore did love you, Hermia,\nDid ever keep your counsels, never wronged you--\nSave that, in love unto Demetrius,\nI told him of your stealth unto this wood.\nHe followed you; for love, I followed him.\nBut he hath chid me hence and threatened me\nTo strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too.\nAnd now, so you will let me quiet go,\nTo Athens will I bear my folly back\nAnd follow you no further. Let me go.\nYou see how simple and how fond I am.\n\nHERMIA\nWhy, get you gone. Who is 't that hinders you?\n\nHELENA\nA foolish heart that I leave here behind.\n\nHERMIA\nWhat, with Lysander?\n\nHELENA  With Demetrius.\n\nLYSANDER\nBe not afraid. She shall not harm thee, Helena.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nNo, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.\n\nHELENA\nO, when she is angry, she is keen and shrewd.\nShe was a vixen when she went to school,\nAnd though she be but little, she is fierce.\n\nHERMIA\n\"Little\" again? Nothing but \"low\" and \"little\"?\nWhy will you suffer her to flout me thus?\nLet me come to her.\n\nLYSANDER  Get you gone, you dwarf,\nYou minimus of hind'ring knotgrass made,\nYou bead\n######################\nOutput:",

O, were favor so!\nYours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.\nMy ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye;\nMy tongue should catch your tongue's sweet\nmelody.\nWere the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\nThe rest I'd give to be to you translated.\nO, teach me how you look and with what art\nYou sway the motion of Demetrius' heart!\n\nHERMIA\nI frown upon him, yet he loves me still.\n\nHELENA\nO, that your frowns would teach my smiles such\nskill!\n\nHERMIA\nI give him curses, yet he gives me love.\n\nHELENA\nO, that my prayers could such affection move!\n\nHERMIA\nThe more I hate, the more he follows me.\n\nHELENA\nThe more I love, the more he hateth me.\n\nHERMIA\nHis folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\n\nHELENA\nNone but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!\n\nHERMIA\nTake comfort: he no more shall see my face.\nLysander and myself will fly this place.\nBefore the time I did Lysander see\nSeemed Athens as a paradise to me.\nO, then, what graces in my love do dwell\nThat he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!\n\nLYSANDER\nHelen, to you our minds we will unfold.\nTomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold\nHer silver visage in the wat'ry glass,\nDecking with liquid pearl the bladed grass\n(A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal),\nThrough Athens' gates have we devised to steal.\n\nHERMIA\nAnd in the wood where often you and I\nUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,\nEmptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,\nThere my Lysander and myself shall meet\nAnd thence from Athens turn away our eyes\nTo seek new friends and stranger companies.\nFarewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,\nAnd good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.--\nKeep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight\nFrom lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.\n\nLYSANDER\nI will, my Hermia.\t[Hermia exits.]\nHelena, adieu.\nAs you on him, Demetrius dote on you!\n[Lysander exits.]\n\nHELENA\nHow happy some o'er other some can be!\nThrough Athens I am thought as fair as she.\nBut what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.\nHe will not know what all but he do know.\nAnd, as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,\nSo I, admiring of his qualities.\nThings base and vile, holding no quantity,\nLove can transpose to form and dignity.\nLove looks not with the eyes but with the mind;\nAnd therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\nNor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste.\nWings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.\nAnd therefore is Love said to be a child\nBecause in choice he is so oft beguiled.\nAs waggish boys in game themselves forswear,\nSo the boy Love is perjured everywhere.\nFor, ere Demetrius looked on Hermia's eyne,\nHe hailed down oaths that he was only mine;\nAnd when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,\nSo he dissolved, and show'rs of oaths did melt.\nI will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight.\nThen to the wood will he tomorrow night\nPursue her. And, for this intelligence\nIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense.\nBut herein mean I to enrich my pain,\nTo have his sight thither and back again.\n[She exits.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Quince the carpenter, and Snug the joiner, and\nBottom the weaver, and Flute the bellows-mender, and\nSnout the tinker, and Starveling the tailor.]\n\n\nQUINCE  Is all our company here?\n\nBOTTOM  You were best to call them generally, man by\nman, according to the scrip.\n######################\nOutput:",

A cry more tunable\nWas never holloed to, nor cheered with horn,\nIn Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.\nJudge when you hear.--But soft! What nymphs are\nthese?\n\nEGEUS\nMy lord, this is my daughter here asleep,\nAnd this Lysander; this Demetrius is,\nThis Helena, old Nedar's Helena.\nI wonder of their being here together.\n\nTHESEUS\nNo doubt they rose up early to observe\nThe rite of May, and hearing our intent,\nCame here in grace of our solemnity.\nBut speak, Egeus.

Man is but an ass if he go about\nto expound this dream. Methought I was--there\nis no man can tell what. Methought I was and\nmethought I had--but man is but a patched fool if\nhe will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of\nman hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen,\nman's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to\nconceive, nor his heart to report what my dream\nwas. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this\ndream. It shall be called \"Bottom's Dream\" because\nit hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the\nlatter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure,\nto make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her\ndeath.\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Quince, Flute, Snout, and Starveling.]\n\n\nQUINCE  Have you sent to Bottom's house?

The lover, all as frantic,\nSees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt.\nThe poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,\nDoth glance from heaven to Earth, from Earth to\nheaven,\nAnd as imagination bodies forth\nThe forms of things unknown, the poet's pen\nTurns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing\nA local habitation and a name.\nSuch tricks hath strong imagination\nThat, if it would but apprehend some joy,\nIt comprehends some bringer of that joy.\nOr in the night, imagining some fear,\nHow easy is a bush supposed a bear!\n\nHIPPOLYTA\nBut all the story of the night told over,\nAnd all their minds transfigured so together,\nMore witnesseth than fancy's images\nAnd grows to something of great constancy,\nBut, howsoever, strange and admirable.\n\n[Enter Lovers: Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena.]\n\n\nTHESEUS\nHere come the lovers full of joy and mirth.--\nJoy, gentle friends!

I'll be gone.\nOur queen and all her elves come here anon.\n\nROBIN\nThe King doth keep his revels here tonight.\nTake heed the Queen come not within his sight,\nFor Oberon is passing fell and wrath\nBecause that she, as her attendant, hath\nA lovely boy stolen from an Indian king;\nShe never had so sweet a changeling.\nAnd jealous Oberon would have the child\nKnight of his train, to trace the forests wild.\nBut she perforce withholds the loved boy,\nCrowns him with flowers and makes him all her\njoy.\nAnd now they never meet in grove or green,\nBy fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen,\nBut they do square, that all their elves for fear\nCreep into acorn cups and hide them there.\n\nFAIRY\nEither I mistake your shape and making quite,\nOr else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite\nCalled Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he\nThat frights the maidens of the villagery,\nSkim milk, and sometimes labor in the quern\nAnd bootless make the breathless huswife churn,\nAnd sometime make the drink to bear no barm,\nMislead night wanderers, laughing at their harm?\nThose that \"Hobgoblin\" call you and \"sweet Puck,\"\nYou do their work, and they shall have good luck.\nAre not you he?\n\nROBIN  Thou speakest aright.\nI am that merry wanderer of the night.\nI jest to Oberon and make him smile\nWhen I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,\nNeighing in likeness of a filly foal.\nAnd sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl\nIn very likeness of a roasted crab,\nAnd, when she drinks, against her lips I bob\nAnd on her withered dewlap pour the ale.\nThe wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,\nSometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;\nThen slip I from her bum, down topples she\nAnd \"Tailor!\" cries and falls into a cough,\nAnd then the whole choir hold their hips and loffe\nAnd waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear\nA merrier hour was never wasted there.\nBut room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.\n\nFAIRY\nAnd here my mistress. Would that he were gone!\n\n[Enter Oberon the King of Fairies at one door, with his\ntrain, and Titania the Queen at another, with hers.]\n\n\nOBERON\nIll met by moonlight, proud Titania.\n\nTITANIA\nWhat, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence.\nI have forsworn his bed and company.\n\nOBERON\nTarry, rash wanton. Am not I thy lord?\n\nTITANIA\nThen I must be thy lady. But I know\nWhen thou hast stolen away from Fairyland\nAnd in the shape of Corin sat all day\nPlaying on pipes of corn and versing love\nTo amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,\nCome from the farthest steep of India,\nBut that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,\nYour buskined mistress and your warrior love,\nTo Theseus must be wedded, and you come\nTo give their bed joy and prosperity?\n\nOBERON\nHow canst thou thus for shame, Titania,\nGlance at my credit with Hippolyta,\nKnowing I know thy love to Theseus?\nDidst not thou lead him through the glimmering\nnight\nFrom Perigouna, whom he ravished,\nAnd make him with fair Aegles break his faith,\nWith Ariadne and Antiopa?\n\nTITANIA\nThese are the forgeries of jealousy;\n######################\nOutput:",

canst thou thus for shame, Titania,\nGlance at my credit with Hippolyta,\nKnowing I know thy love to Theseus?\nDidst not thou lead him through the glimmering\nnight\nFrom Perigouna, whom he ravished,\nAnd make him with fair Aegles break his faith,\nWith Ariadne and Antiopa?\n\nTITANIA\nThese are the forgeries of jealousy;\nAnd never, since the middle summer's spring,\nMet we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,\nBy paved fountain or by rushy brook,\nOr in the beached margent of the sea,\nTo dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,\nBut with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.\nTherefore the winds, piping to us in vain,\nAs in revenge have sucked up from the sea\nContagious fogs, which, falling in the land,\nHath every pelting river made so proud\nThat they have overborne their continents.\nThe ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain,\nThe plowman lost his sweat, and the green corn\nHath rotted ere his youth attained a beard.\nThe fold stands empty in the drowned field,\nAnd crows are fatted with the murrain flock.\nThe nine-men's-morris is filled up with mud,\nAnd the quaint mazes in the wanton green,\nFor lack of tread, are undistinguishable.\nThe human mortals want their winter here.\nNo night is now with hymn or carol blessed.\nTherefore the moon, the governess of floods,\nPale in her anger, washes all the air,\nThat rheumatic diseases do abound.\nAnd thorough this distemperature we see\nThe seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts\nFall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,\nAnd on old Hiems' thin and icy crown\nAn odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds\nIs, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,\nThe childing autumn, angry winter, change\nTheir wonted liveries, and the mazed world\nBy their increase now knows not which is which.\nAnd this same progeny of evils comes\nFrom our debate, from our dissension;\nWe are their parents and original.\n\nOBERON\nDo you amend it, then. It lies in you.\nWhy should Titania cross her Oberon?\nI do but beg a little changeling boy\nTo be my henchman.\n\nTITANIA  Set your heart at rest:\nThe Fairyland buys not the child of me.\nHis mother was a vot'ress of my order,\nAnd in the spiced Indian air by night\nFull often hath she gossiped by my side\nAnd sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,\nMarking th' embarked traders on the flood,\nWhen we have laughed to see the sails conceive\nAnd grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;\nWhich she, with pretty and with swimming gait,\nFollowing (her womb then rich with my young\nsquire),\nWould imitate and sail upon the land\nTo fetch me trifles and return again,\nAs from a voyage, rich with merchandise.\nBut she, being mortal, of that boy did die,\nAnd for her sake do I rear up her boy,\nAnd for her sake I will not part with him.\n\nOBERON\nHow long within this wood intend you stay?\n\nTITANIA\nPerchance till after Theseus' wedding day.\nIf you will patiently dance in our round\nAnd see our moonlight revels, go with us.\nIf not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.\n\nOBERON\nGive me that boy and I will go with thee.\n\nTITANIA\nNot for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.\nWe shall chide downright if I longer stay.\n[Titania and her fairies exit.]\n\nOBERON\nWell, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove\nTill I torment thee for this injury.--\nMy gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb'rest\nSince once I sat upon a promontory\nAnd heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back\nUttering such dulcet and harmonious breath\nThat the rude sea grew civil at her song\nAnd certain stars shot madly from their spheres\nTo hear the sea-maid's music.\n\nROBIN  I remember.\n\nOBERON\nThat very time I saw (but thou couldst not),\nFlying between the cold moon and the Earth,\nCupid all armed. A certain aim he took\nAt a fair vestal throned by the west,\nAnd loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow\nAs it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.\nBut I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft\nQuenched in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon,\nAnd the imperial vot'ress passed on\nIn maiden meditation, fancy-free.\nYet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.\nIt fell upon a little western flower,\nBefore, milk-white, now purple with love's wound,\nAnd maidens call it \"love-in-idleness.\"\nFetch me that flower; the herb I showed thee once.\nThe juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid\nWill make or man or woman madly dote\nUpon the next live creature that it sees.\nFetch me this herb, and be thou here again\nEre the leviathan can swim a league.\n\nROBIN\nI'll put a girdle round about the Earth\nIn forty minutes.\t[He exits.]\n\nOBERON  Having once this juice,\nI'll watch Titania when she is asleep\nAnd drop the liquor of it in her eyes\n######################\nOutput:",

Yonder is thy dear.\n\n[Enter Hermia.]\n\n\nHERMIA, [to Lysander]\nDark night, that from the eye his function takes,\nThe ear more quick of apprehension makes;\nWherein it doth impair the seeing sense,\nIt pays the hearing double recompense.\nThou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;\nMine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.\nBut why unkindly didst thou leave me so?\n\nLYSANDER\nWhy should he stay whom love doth press to go?\n\nHERMIA\nWhat love could press Lysander from my side?\n\nLYSANDER\nLysander's love, that would not let him bide,\nFair Helena, who more engilds the night\nThan all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.\nWhy seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee\nknow\nThe hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?\n\nHERMIA\nYou speak not as you think. It cannot be.\n\nHELENA\nLo, she is one of this confederacy!\nNow I perceive they have conjoined all three\nTo fashion this false sport in spite of me.--\nInjurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid,\nHave you conspired, have you with these contrived,\nTo bait me with this foul derision?\nIs all the counsel that we two have shared,\nThe sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent\nWhen we have chid the hasty-footed time\nFor parting us--O, is all forgot?\nAll schooldays' friendship, childhood innocence?\nWe, Hermia, like two artificial gods,\nHave with our needles created both one flower,\nBoth on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,\nBoth warbling of one song, both in one key,\nAs if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds\nHad been incorporate. So we grew together\nLike to a double cherry, seeming parted,\nBut yet an union in partition,\nTwo lovely berries molded on one stem;\nSo with two seeming bodies but one heart,\nTwo of the first, like coats in heraldry,\nDue but to one, and crowned with one crest.\nAnd will you rent our ancient love asunder,\nTo join with men in scorning your poor friend?\nIt is not friendly; 'tis not maidenly.\nOur sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,\nThough I alone do feel the injury.\n\nHERMIA\nI am amazed at your words.\nI scorn you not. It seems that you scorn me.\n\nHELENA\nHave you not set Lysander, as in scorn,\nTo follow me and praise my eyes and face,\nAnd made your other love, Demetrius,\nWho even but now did spurn me with his foot,\nTo call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,\nPrecious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this\nTo her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander\nDeny your love (so rich within his soul)\nAnd tender me, forsooth, affection,\nBut by your setting on, by your consent?\nWhat though I be not so in grace as you,\nSo hung upon with love, so fortunate,\nBut miserable most, to love unloved?\nThis you should pity rather than despise.\n\nHERMIA\nI understand not what you mean by this.\n\nHELENA\nAy, do. Persever, counterfeit sad looks,\nMake mouths upon me when I turn my back,\nWink each at other, hold the sweet jest up.\nThis sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.\nIf you have any pity, grace, or manners,\nYou would not make me such an argument.\nBut fare you well. 'Tis partly my own fault,\nWhich death or absence soon shall remedy.\n\nLYSANDER\nStay, gentle Helena. Hear my excuse,\nMy love, my life, my soul, fair Helena.\n\nHELENA\nO excellent!\n\nHERMIA, [to Lysander]\nSweet, do not scorn her so.\n\nDEMETRIUS, [to Lysander]\nIf she cannot entreat, I can compel.\n\nLYSANDER\nThou canst compel no more than she entreat.\nThy threats have no more strength than her weak\nprayers.--\nHelen, I love thee. By my life, I do.\nI swear by that which I will lose for thee,\nTo prove him false that says I love thee not.\n\nDE\n######################\nOutput:",

I never heard\nSo musical a discord, such sweet thunder.\n\nTHESEUS\nMy hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,\nSo flewed, so sanded; and their heads are hung\nWith ears that sweep away the morning dew;\nCrook-kneed, and dewlapped like Thessalian bulls;\nSlow in pursuit, but matched in mouth like bells,\nEach under each. A cry more tunable\nWas never holloed to, nor cheered with horn,\nIn Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.\nJudge when you hear.--But soft! What nymphs are\nthese?\n\nEGEUS\nMy lord, this is my daughter here asleep,\nAnd this Lysander; this Demetrius is,\nThis Helena, old Nedar's Helena.\nI wonder of their being here together.\n\nTHESEUS\nNo doubt they rose up early to observe\nThe rite of May, and hearing our intent,\nCame here in grace of our solemnity.\nBut speak, Egeus. Is not this the day\nThat Hermia should give answer of her choice?\n\nEGEUS  It is, my lord.\n\nTHESEUS\nGo, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.\n[A Servant exits.]\n[Shout within.

But as yet, I swear,\nI cannot truly say how I came here.\nBut, as I think--for truly would I speak,\nAnd now I do bethink me, so it is:\nI came with Hermia hither.

To her, my lord,\nWas I betrothed ere I saw Hermia.\nBut like a sickness did I loathe this food.\nBut, as in health, come to my natural taste,\nNow I do wish it, love it, long for it,\nAnd will forevermore be true to it.\n\nTHESEUS\nFair lovers, you are fortunately met.\nOf this discourse we more will hear anon.--\nEgeus, I will overbear your will,\nFor in the temple by and by, with us,\nThese couples shall eternally be knit.--\nAnd, for the morning now is something worn,\nOur purposed hunting shall be set aside.\nAway with us to Athens.

It seems to me\nThat yet we sleep, we dream.

If our sport had gone forward, we had all\nbeen made men.\n\nFLUTE  O, sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence\na day during his life. He could not have\n'scaped sixpence a day. An the Duke had not given\nhim sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be\nhanged. He would have deserved it. Sixpence a day\nin Pyramus, or nothing!\n\n[Enter Bottom.]\n\n\nBOTTOM  Where are these lads? Where are these\nhearts?\n\nQUINCE  Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy\nhour!\n\nBOTTOM  Masters, I am to discourse wonders. But ask\nme not what; for, if I tell you, I am not true\nAthenian. I will tell you everything right as it fell\nout.\n\nQUINCE  Let us hear, sweet Bottom.\n\nBOTTOM  Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is that\nthe Duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,\ngood strings to your beards, new ribbons to your\npumps. Meet presently at the palace. Every man\nlook o'er his part. For the short and the long is, our\nplay is preferred. In any case, let Thisbe have clean\nlinen, and let not him that plays the lion pare his\nnails, for they shall hang out for the lion's claws.\nAnd, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for\nwe are to utter sweet breath, and I do not doubt but\nto hear them say it is a sweet comedy. No more\nwords. Away! Go, away!\n[They exit.]\n\n\nACT 5\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, and Philostrate, Lords, and\nAttendants.]\n\n\nHIPPOLYTA\n'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.\n\nTHESEUS\nMore strange than true. I never may believe\nThese antique fables nor these fairy toys.\nLovers and madmen have such seething brains,\nSuch shaping fantasies, that apprehend\nMore than cool reason ever comprehends.\nThe lunatic, the lover, and the poet\nAre of imagination all compact.\nOne sees more devils than vast hell can hold:\nThat is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,\nSees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt.\nThe poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,\nDoth glance from heaven to Earth, from Earth to\nheaven,\nAnd as imagination bodies forth\nThe forms of things unknown, the poet's pen\nTurns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing\nA local habitation and a name.\nSuch tricks hath strong imagination\nThat, if it would but apprehend some joy,\nIt comprehends some bringer of that joy.\nOr in the night, imagining some fear,\nHow easy is a bush supposed a bear!\n\nHIPPOLYTA\nBut all the story of the night told over,\nAnd all their minds transfigured so together,\nMore witnesseth than fancy's images\nAnd grows to something of great constancy,\nBut, howsoever, strange and admirable.\n\n[Enter Lovers: Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena.]\n\n\nTHESEUS\nHere come the lovers full of joy and mirth.--\nJoy, gentle friends!
