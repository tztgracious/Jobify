Be advised, fair maid.\nTo you, your father should be as a god,\nOne that composed your beauties, yea, and one\nTo whom you are but as a form in wax\nBy him imprinted, and within his power\nTo leave the figure or disfigure it.\nDemetrius is a worthy gentleman.\n\nHERMIA\nSo is Lysander.\n\nTHESEUS  In himself he is,\nBut in this kind, wanting your father's voice,\nThe other must be held the worthier.\n\nHERMIA\nI would my father looked but with my eyes.\n\nTHESEUS\nRather your eyes must with his judgment look.\n\nHERMIA\nI do entreat your Grace to pardon me.\nI know not by what power I am made bold,\nNor how it may concern my modesty\nIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts;\nBut I beseech your Grace that I may know\nThe worst that may befall me in this case\nIf I refuse to wed Demetrius.\n\nTHESEUS\nEither to die the death or to abjure\nForever the society of men.\nTherefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,\nKnow of your youth, examine well your blood,\nWhether (if you yield not to your father's choice)\nYou can endure the livery of a nun,\nFor aye to be in shady cloister mewed,\nTo live a barren sister all your life,\nChant\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_09ddfd3609db93c0488d0448d4f79a88d5221af28d69423465b722962d2060a2_v2"}
