## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Database Locking (SQLite)

- **Issue**: Background resume parsing can cause "database table is locked" errors in test environments
- **Cause**: SQLite's limited concurrent access when using threading
- **Solution**: Integration tests handle this gracefully and continue execution
- **Impact**: Minimal - keywords may be empty but workflow continues successfully

### Resume Parsing Dependencies

- **Requirement**: OpenAI API key for keyword extraction and question generation
- **Fallback**: System continues without keywords if parsing fails
- **Configuration**: Set `OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable
