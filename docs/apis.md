## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Database Locking (SQLite)

- **Issue**: Background resume parsing can cause "database table is locked" errors in test environments
- **Cause**: SQLite's limited concurrent access when using threading
- **Solution**: Integration tests handle this gracefully and continue execution
- **Impact**: Minimal - keywords may be empty but workflow continues successfully

### Resume Parsing Dependencies

- **Requirement**: OpenAI API key for keyword extraction and question generation
- **Fallback**: System continues without keywords if parsing fails
- **Configuration**: Set `OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable

## Release Notes

### v2.0.0 - Dual Answer Type Support

**🎉 Major Feature Update**: Complete dual text/video answer support with proper API differentiation

**✅ New Features**:

- **Dual Answer Types**: Text and video answers with separate processing pipelines
- **Response Differentiation**: Clean API responses - text answers don't include video fields and vice versa
- **Video Upload**: 75MB video file support with unique filename generation and secure storage
- **Enhanced Validation**: Comprehensive input validation for both answer types
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time interview progress calculation and completion status
- **Utility Functions**: Separate `process_text_answer()` and `process_video_answer()` functions

**🔧 Technical Improvements**:

- Refactored `submit_interview_answer()` to use utility functions for better maintainability
- Enhanced error handling with proper status codes for all scenarios
- Video file storage in dedicated `interview_videos/` directory with collision-safe naming
- Clean separation of concerns between text and video processing logic

**📊 Current Status**:

- Text-based interview flow: 100% functional with AI feedback
- Video upload and storage: 100% functional
- Video feedback processing: Infrastructure ready, implementation pending

**⚠️ Known Limitations**:

- Video answer feedback returns 501 Not Implemented (planned for future release)
